# Web-course-Final-project

The idea behind the app is simple.
You are avid reader and like to write alternative stories or just like to write. Fanfiction app is platform 
for you to share your work with like minded people.
You can add your stories and chapters in them or delete stories and chapters, follow others stories unfollow them.
User also receive notification if followed story get a new chapter.
User cna comment ot stories or rate them.But rating is done only once per a story from a user.
User is not allowed to rate multiple times a story.
Users can write messages to other users only if they are not blocked.
User can block/unblock user.
Administration is handled by admins and moderators.
Admins are in god mode can delete everything users stories ect.
Moderators can only moderate stories comments.

I should add new functionality and refactor it a bit. But will see when I find the time.
